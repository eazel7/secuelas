Nothing yet. Hope it to be a Web SQL Server UI

# Development

- Install and have running a MongoDB at localhost (I'll later change it to be TingoDB so no MongoDB is required)
- Run `npm npm install && npm install --only=dev`
- Open a terminal and run `npm run watch`
- Open another terminal and run `npm run start`

# APIs

> TBD
